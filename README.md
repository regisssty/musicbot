# MusicBot

MusicBot is a music bot (yeah, another bot in this world) built on top of [Klasa](https://github.com/dirigeants/klasa/), and uses [Discord.js](https://github.com/hydrabolt/discord.js) to connect to the Discord API.

## Features

- All basic music bot commands, included skip prompting (based on the 40% of users connected to the voice channel, after 4 users).
- An echo command, because, why not?
- Clean code, easy to modify. Fully modular and classbased.
- Full Music Handler interface and caching, make sure she replies 'smartly'!

## Requirements

- `git` command line ([Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win)|[Linux](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)|[MacOS](https://git-scm.com/download/mac)) installed
- `node` [Version 8.1.0 or higher](https://nodejs.org)
- `ffmpeg`: `npm install --global ffmpeg-binaries`
- `node-opus`: `npm install node-opus` (alternatively you can use opusscript, but it's very bad for production, has memoryleaks and stream/quality issues).
- A **good** network connection.

## Downloading

In a command prompt in your projects folder (wherever that may be) run the following:

```
git clone https://github.com/kyranet/MusicBot
```

Once finished:

- In the folder from where you ran the git command, run `cd MusicBot` and then run `npm install`
- Rename `config.json.example` to `config.json`
- Edit `config.json` and enter your bot token and the YouTube Search API token.
